# WordleStats - Enlightenment shortcuts for playing Wordle on iOS Safari

The WordleStats shortcuts can be added to iOS and used when playing the official [New York Times Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) game in the Safari browser. WordleStats offers enhancements to the game experience and an enriched sharing experience.

## Share with WordleStats

Instead of using the Share button built into Wordle, the 'Share with WordleStats' shortcut can be used to enhance the content shared from the game. The enhancements include showing your all-time game statistics, current and max win streaks, and how many possible words remained after each of your guesses. The shortcut asks whether to share only the game, only your stats, or both.

Here's an example of what gets shared via WordleStats:

#Wordle 1,252 4/6*

## Check Guess with WordleStats

Do you wish that Wordle would warn you if a guess has already appeared as a previous solution? The 'Check Guess with WordleStats' shortcut does just that!

Enter your guess into the Wordle game and invoke the shortcut. A message will be shown indicating whether the pending guess has already been used. Alternatively, if you invoke the shortcut before entering your guess into the game, you can type your guess into a prompt first. This can be helpful if you want to be extra careful about entering your guess.

## Show Possibilities with WordleStats

After finishing a game, I love to see what other words were possibilities as I was narrowing it down to the solution. The 'Show Possibilities with WordleStats' shortcut figures this out and shows them on the screen. Words that have already appeared as Wordle solutions are indicated.

Note that this shortcut can be used to gain a cheat in the game. If you invoke this shortcut before the game is over, the remaining possibilities will be shown. While I don't use the shortcut in this manner, the capability is there.

Words are shown for each guess were 25 or fewer possibilities remained. There's an additional 'Show More Possibilities with WordleStats' shortcut that prompts for the maximum word count.
